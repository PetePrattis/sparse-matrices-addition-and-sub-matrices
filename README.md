# A C++ Project

**This is a simple C++ project from my early days as a Computer Science student**

_This programm was created for the second semester class Sata Structures 
and is one of two such simple C++ programms neccessary to pass the class_


> #### Description of project (2 exercises)
>
>>Exercise one is addition of two sparse tables / matrices. The implementation of the addition of tables should have a time complexity 
of Θ(nA + nB) where nA and nB are the number of non-zero elements of tables A and B. Also I minimize the total space necessary for 
implementing the addition of tables. Ideally, this program should use Θ(nC) space where nC is the number of non-zero elements
of the result table C. Finally, the program prints table C in its two-dimensional form, including its zero elements.
>
>>Exercise two is a program that returns a 2X2 sub table (if any) from table A, whose sum of elements is greater than a variable c. 
For example if c = 80 then the program should return the sub array C<br>
[02  0]<br>
[30 40]

> #### Functionality (2 implementations)
>
> 1. The first implementation uses 2d arrays
> 2. The second implementation use linked-lists to reduce size and time complexity

> #### About this project
>
> - The comments to make the code understandable, are within the archives
> - This program was written in CodeBlocks
> - This repository was created to show the variety of the work I did and experience I gained as a student
